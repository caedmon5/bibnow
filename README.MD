# bibnow

**bibnow** is an LLM-enhanced bibliography pipeline for automating Zotero + Obsidian entry from chat-sourced metadata.

## ✨ What's Here

- `v2/`: CSL-based modular rewrite (currently in development)
- `biblio_pipeline.py`: Legacy BibTeX-based script (still functional)
- `config.py`: Shared API tokens and constants

## 🚧 v2 Development (Active)
See [`v2/README.md`](v2/README.md) for architecture and contribution notes.

## 🏁 Quick Start for v2

```bash
cd v2
python3 main.py  # or your entry script
