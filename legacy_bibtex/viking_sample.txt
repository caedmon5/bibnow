# Abstract  
A 10th-century Viking Age burial site has been discovered near Lisbjerg, Denmark, containing around 30 graves linked to a noble family possibly connected to King Harald Bluetooth. The graves include pearls, coins, ceramics, gold-threaded boxes, and other ancient artifacts. The Moesgaard Museum in Aarhus is leading the analysis following the completion of excavations.
